# GUH

Welcome to Guh. The pinnacle of software.

Does it do anything? **No.**
Is it important? **Probably.**
Does it say Guh? **Yes.**

## What is this?

This is a high-performance, enterprise-grade Guh application built with the raw unbridled power of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Rust (which is doing absolutely nothing here but looking cool).

## Features

- **Visual Fidelity**: Gazing upon Guh in standard definition.
- **Offline Capability**: Guh is now embedded directly into the binary. The internet can break, society can crumble, but Guh will remain.
- **Advanced State Management**: Right-click anywhere to toggle between "Retro" (for those who miss the 90s) and "Modern" (for those who hate joy).
    - **Retro Mode**: Pixelated font, pixelated Guh. Authentic crunch.
    - **Modern Mode**: Smooth font, smooth Guh. Soulless but high-definition.
- **Window Management**: It has a close button. Use it wisely.

## Installation

Do you really want to install this? Okay.

1.  **Clone it**: Get the code on your machine.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    (or npm, or yarn, whatever floats your boat)
3.  **Run it**:
    ```bash
    pnpm tauri dev
    ```
4.  **Build it**:
    ```bash
    pnpm tauri build
    ```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: It's just a picture of Guh saying Guh.**
A: You're welcome.

**Q: Why does the retro font look so good?**
A: Because we downloaded it. Manually. It's artisanal.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Please don't. The codebase is already perfect.
